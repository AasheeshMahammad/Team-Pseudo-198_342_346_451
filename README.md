# Step1:- EDA & Preprocessing<br />
By:- Kuntal Gorai and Svsc Santosh <br />
This step involves cleaning the data by : - <br />
i)Removing outliers <br />
ii)Replacing Null Values <br />
iii)Removing Duplicate records <br />
Also includes the use of PCA to reduce multicollinearity between attributes in a datamodel <br />
Visualising the data with use of graphs <br />
Reducing the number of columns in dataset having 680 columns to around 6 columns using different approaches <br />
Keeping data ready to be used up by the model for training <br />
<br />
# Step 2:- Training the models and using them for further prediction <br />
